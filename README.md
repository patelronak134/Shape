# Shape
Software Engineering course project

Shape is a fitness-based social media application where users not only have the ability to calculate their caloric needs, set fitness goals, and keep track of their overall progress, but it is also a space in which users may share advice, promote personalized workout routines, and post pictures and comments about their fitness journey. 

It was created by Ronak Patel, Michael Pajares, and Jacob Lunger as the course project for Software Engineering at the County College of Morris in the Spring 2022 semester. It is meant to be used as a learning exercise, and consists of documentation, models, and use cases to better understand the development process.
